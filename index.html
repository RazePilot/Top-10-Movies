    <li><h3>Back To The Future</h3></li>
    <img src="bttfp.jpg"> <img src="mjf.jpg"> <img src="backtothefuture.jpg" width="300" height="200"> 
      <p>Back To The Future is one of those classic movies that you don't have to watch more than once, but is so good that you'll want to anyways. With a relatively simple plot that isn't hammered into our heads, likeable characters, and a story that'll keep anyone engaged; Back To The Future is a timeless film that if definantly worth seeing.</p>
   <p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p>
   <ul>
     <li>Marty McFly</li>
     <li>Doc Brown</li>
     <li>Biff</li>

<!--Back To The Future 2-->
    <li><h3>Back To The Future 2</h3></li>
    <img src="bttf2.jpg"> <img src="mjf.jpg"> <img src="hoverhold.jpg" width="300" height="200">
      <p>Just like the first film, Back To The Future 2 is an exhillirating time-traveling ride through another time from an 80's perspective. It continues the story of the first movie with our main character traveling foreward in time to save the world. The movie is sort of a reversal of the first one, but is still a blast to watch; even if their depiction of now was a bit skewed.

    <li><h3>Jurassic Park</h3></li>
    <img src="jpposter.jpg"> <img src="samneill.jpg"> <img src="kidface.jpg" height="200" width="300">
    <p>Jurassic Park is one big sci-fi "what if" movie; where dinosaurs attack people on an island. It's a classic movie with oustanding visual effects that still hold up to this day. Jurassic Park is a movie that everyone should see, even if they don't like dinosaurs.</p>
   <p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p>
   <ul>
     <li>Grant</li>
     <li>Ellie</li>
     <li>Malcom</li>

<!--John Wick-->
   <li><h3>John Wick</h3></li>
   <img src="johnpost.jpg"> <img src="keanureeves.jpg"> <img src="keanwithgun.jpg" height="200" width="300">
    <p>John Wick is essentially a movie that takes place entirely inside of my head whenever I listen to a cool song. John Wick is a complete badass for the entire film, and watching it is the most exhillirating thing I think I've ever witnessed. This movie is great for any time you want to watch a film but don't really care about getting invested in the story. It's an absolute Must-See.</p>
    <p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>John Wick</li>
        <li>Viggo Tarasnov</li>
        <li>Marcus</li>
        </ul>

<!--Ghostbusters-->
    <li><h3>Ghostbusters</h3></li>
    <img src="ghostposters.jpg"> <img src="billmurray.jpg"> <img src="ghostbusting.jpg" height="200" width="400">
     <p>Ghostbusters is a movie that has its own theme song. Which is all you really need to know other than it's a great film to watch any time of the year.</p>
     <p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p>
     <ul>
      <li>Venkman</li>
      <li>Stantz</li>

<!--Who Killed Captain Alex-->
    <li><h3>Who Killed Captain Alex</h3></li>
    <img src="whokilledposter.jpg"> <img src="captain.jpg" height="150" width="200"> <img src="helicopterexplode.jpg" height="150" width="200">
    <p>Who Killed Captain Alex is Ugandas first action movie. Ever. It was made by a group of people in a small town who just wanted to make a fun film. The plot is bland, the acting is bad, and there are some weird, non-conventional things in the film that are a little off-putting at first. If I were to review this film in the same way I would the other films on this list, I'd probably give it a 1 out of 10. But I can't do that, because it's not a big budget Hollywood film; it's a movie that was made by people who have no film experience, in an impoverished country. It was something they made because they love film, and wanted to make their mark on the world. The movie is free on youtube, or you can support Wakaliwood <a href="http://watch.wakaliwood.com/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Captain Alex</li>
  <li>Alex</li>
  <li>Richard</li>
</ul>

<!--Monty Python and the Holy Grail-->
    <li><h3>Monty Python and the holy Grail</h3></li>
    <img src="mphg.jpg"> <img src="grahmchapman.jpg"> <img src="headgone.jpg" height="200" width="300">
<p>Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of <strong>those</strong> movies. You know what I'm talking about. Movies that are so bad they're good. A fun film filled with dumb jokes and good acting. I'd consider it a classic at this point, and I recommend watching it.</p> 
<p><strong>Main Characters</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>King Arthur</li>
  <li>Sir Lancelot The Brave</li>
  <li>Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot</li>
</ul>
